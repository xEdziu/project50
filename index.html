        Project50 is a lifestyle challenge made for the top 1% of tomorrow. If
        you're a creative, athlete, entrepreneur, high-performer or if you just
        want to start living your life to the fullest this is for you. Ever saw
        someone and thought to yourself: How do they do all of it? We spent
        years connecting, learning and studying a group of people that are the
        most successful, ambitious sought-after in their industry: The so called
        „Top 1%“. But... who are they? The people that belong to this group are
        to be found everywhere. They are the ones that outperform 99% of the
        rest. All the time. Although all of these people are very unique, after
        analyzing their characters, it was more than clear to us, that they all
        have certain habits in common, which put them at the top of the chain
        and make them so successful. We took the 7 most important traits, and
        formed them into an every-day lifestyle challenge, consisting of 7
        rules. We challenge you, to follow these rules for 50 days, the exact
        time it takes to form habits to keep them forever. If you want to be
        part of the 1%, if you want to turn your life around and maximize your
        potential, you need to start this challenge. There is more to the life
        you're living. Stop depriving yourself of what you can be and start
        now.<br /><br />
        I created this page to let people connect throught their progress and
        see, how are their friends doing in keeping an online journal. Joining
        this community is completly free, as I don't request any money from this
        project. I treat it as another project to my portfolio. Feel free to
        join and add your friends, while completing this uniqe challange.

          The 7 most important practices included under this challenge are:
        </p>
        <ol class="list">
          <li>
            <h2 class="heading">RULE 1: WAKE UP BEFORE 8 A.M.</h2>
            <p>
              Every day for 50 days you need to wake up before 8AM. Having said
              that, you need to get at least 6 hours of sleep and maintain a
              consistent bed routine. Having a proper sleep cycle is a must. It
              is proven that waking up early puts an individual in good mood
              throughout the day. It also gives you more time in the day to
              complete all your tasks.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2 class="heading">RULE 2: DO YOUR MORNING ROUTINE</h2>
            <p>
              Do your morning routine: 1h no distractions (no phone and social
              media). Set yourself a proper morning routine that you'd like to
              follow for the next 50 days. Your morning routine can include
              activities like making your bed, drinking your morning coffee/tea,
              meditating, spending some time with your loved ones, or spending
              some time with yourselves to reflect, drinking adequate water,
              planning your day, your errands, etc. Anything that keeps you away
              from your distractions will do.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2 class="heading">RULE 3: EXERCISE FOR 1H A DAY</h2>
            <p>
              Physical activity is very important. Under this challenge, you
              need to work out for 1 hour daily, either you can choose to
              continue performing the same activity every day or you can choose
              to have any kind of physical activity done. You can choose from-
              swimming, cycling, working out, yoga, playing any sport, etc. Make
              sure you do not miss a day. Performing any kind of physical
              activity every day not only keeps you fit physically but also
              keeps your mental health in check.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2 class="heading">RULE 4: READ 10 PAGES A DAY</h2>
            <p>
              Reading at least 10 pages of your chosen book is the next rule.
              Reading helps to enhance your vocabulary and knowledge. It also
              increases your imagination and creativity, giving you a better
              understanding of how to improve yourself if it's a self-help book
              or if you're interested in history, it gives you a better
              understanding in that area. Additionally, reading helps to relax
              and reduces stress. Moreover, it keeps you away from the
              distractions that are doing us no good.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2 class="heading">RULE 5: DEDICATE 1H TOWARDS A NEW SKILL</h2>
            <p>
              I've realized that due to our hectic schedule we neglect the
              skills we're keen to learn about. For example, ever since I can
              remember I want to improve my programming skills but because my
              day is packed with mundane tasks, I do not make any extra efforts
              to take out time and learn it. Under project 50 you have to
              diligently give 1 hour to the skill you really want to pursue.
              Learning a new skill, without any doubt, adds to your knowledge
              and keeps you up to date. In addition, it also helps you to relax
              when you do something you absolutely love. It can be singing,
              painting, coding, designing, anything that you want to master.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2 class="heading">RULE 6: FOLLOW A HEALTHY DIET</h2>
            <p>
              We are so concerned about how we look, what we wear, etc. but we
              seem to be neglecting what we put into our body which eventually
              gets us healthy-looking skin, healthier hair and so much more.
              Having a healthy diet benefits us in areas such as it keeps us
              fit, giving us healthy, glowing skin, it also improves our mental
              health. It is recommended to have no junk food for these 50 days.
              No cheat days. No junk food.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2 class="heading">
              RULE 7: TRACK YOUR DAILY PROGRESS IN A JOURNAL
            </h2>
            <p>
              Keeping a journal helps to track your progress. It is a proven
              fact that keeping a journal helps in gaining confidence as well.
              After 50 days when you look back and go through our progress,
              you'll be nothing but proud of yourselves.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2 class="heading">GENERAL PROJECT50 RULE</h2>
            <p>
              If you fail on any of the 50 days, start over at day 1. Repeat
              until finished.
