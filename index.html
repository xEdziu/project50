            Project50 is a lifestyle challenge made for the top 1% of tomorrow.
            If you're a creative, athlete, entrepreneur, high-performer or if you just want to start living your life to the fullest this is for you. 
            Ever saw someone and thought to yourself: How do they do all of it?        
            We spent years connecting, learning and studying a group of people that are the most successful, ambitious sought-after in their industry:
            The so called „Top 1%“.           
            But... who are they?            
            The people that belong to this group are to be found everywhere. They are the ones that outperform 99% of the rest. All the time.
            Although all of these people are very unique, after analyzing their characters, it was more than clear to us, that they all have certain habits in common,
            which put them at the top of the chain and make them so successful. 
            We took the 7 most important traits, and formed them into an every-day lifestyle challenge, consisting of 7 rules.
            We challenge you, to follow these rules for 50 days, the exact time it takes to form habits to keep them forever. 
            If you want to be part of the 1%, if you want to turn your life around and maximize your potential, you need to start this challenge. 
            There is more to the life you're living. Stop depriving yourself of what you can be and start now.<br><br>
            I created this page to let people connect throught their progress and see, how are their friends doing in keeping an online journal.

            The 7 most important practices included under this challenge are:

        <ol class="list">
            <li>
                <div class="heading"><b>RULE 1: WAKE UP BEFORE 8 A.M.</b></div>
                <p>
                    Every day for 50 days you need to wake up
                    before 8AM. Having said that, you need to get
                    at least 6 hours of sleep and maintain a
                    consistent bed routine. Having a proper sleep
                    cycle is a must. It is proven that waking up
                    early puts an individual in good mood
                    throughout the day. It also gives you more time
                    in the day to complete all your tasks.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="heading"><b>RULE 2: DO YOUR MORNING ROUTINE</b></div>
                <p>
                    Do your morning routine: 1h no distractions (no phone and social media).
                    Set yourself a proper morning routine that you'd like to follow for the next 50 days. 
                    Your morning routine can include activities like making your bed, drinking your morning coffee/tea, 
                    meditating, spending some time with your loved ones, or spending some time with yourselves to reflect, 
                    drinking adequate water, planning your day, your errands, etc. Anything that keeps 
                    you away from your distractions will do.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="heading"><b>RULE 3: EXERCISE FOR 1H A DAY</b></div>
                <p>
                    Physical activity is very important. Under this challenge, you need to work out for 1 hour daily, 
                    either you can choose to continue performing the same activity every day or you can choose to 
                    have any kind of physical activity done. You can choose from- swimming, cycling, working out, 
                    yoga, playing any sport, etc. Make sure you do not miss a day. Performing any kind of 
                    physical activity every day not only keeps you fit physically 
                    but also keeps your mental health in check.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="heading"><b>RULE 4: READ 10 PAGES A DAY</b></div>
                <p>
                    Reading at least 10 pages of your chosen book is the next rule. Reading helps to enhance your 
                    vocabulary and knowledge. It also increases your imagination and creativity, giving you a better 
                    understanding of how to improve yourself if it's a self-help book or if you're interested in history, 
                    it gives you a better understanding in that area. Additionally, reading helps to relax and reduces 
                    stress. Moreover, it keeps you away from the distractions that are doing us no good.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="heading"><b>RULE 5: DEDICATE 1H TOWARDS A NEW SKILL</b></div>
                <p>
                    I've realized that due to our hectic schedule we neglect the skills we're keen to learn about. 
                    For example, ever since I can remember I want to improve my programming skills but 
                    because my day is packed with mundane tasks, I do not make any extra efforts to take out time 
                    and learn it. Under project 50 you have to diligently give 1 hour to the skill 
                    you really want to pursue. Learning a new skill, without any doubt, adds to your knowledge 
                    and keeps you up to date. In addition, it also helps you to relax when you do something you 
                    absolutely love. It can be singing, painting, coding, designing, anything that you want to master.

            <li>
                <div class="heading"><b>RULE 6: FOLLOW A HEALTHY DIET</b></div>
                <p>
                    We are so concerned about how we look, what we wear, etc. but we seem to 
                    be neglecting what we put into our body which eventually gets us healthy-looking skin, 
                    healthier hair and so much more. Having a healthy diet benefits us in areas such as it keeps 
                    us fit, giving us healthy, glowing skin, it also improves our mental health. It is recommended 
                    to have no junk food for these 50 days. No cheat days. No junk food.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="heading"><b>RULE 7: TRACK YOUR DAILY PROGRESS IN A JOURNAL</b></div>
                <p>
                    Keeping a journal helps to track your progress. It is a proven fact that keeping a 
                    journal helps in gaining confidence as well. After 50 days when you look back and go 
                    through our progress, you'll be nothing but proud of yourselves.
